+ *              In addition, Berkeley UNIX system calls "times ()" or "time ()"

+ *
+ ***************************************************************************
+ *
+ *  History:    This version C/2.1 has been made for two reasons:
+ *
+ *              1) There is an obvious need for a common C version of
+ *              Dhrystone, since C is at present the most popular system
+ *              programming language for the class of processors
+ *              (microcomputers, minicomputers) where Dhrystone is used most.
+ *              There should be, as far as possible, only one C version of
+ *              Dhrystone such that results can be compared without
+ *              restrictions. In the past, the C versions distributed
+ *              by Rick Richardson (Version 1.1) and by Reinhold Weicker
+ *              had small (though not significant) differences.
+ *
+ *              2) As far as it is possible without changes to the Dhrystone
+ *              statistics, optimizing compilers should be prevented from
+ *              removing significant statements.
+ *
+ *              This C version has been developed in cooperation with
+ *              Rick Richardson (Tinton Falls, NJ), it incorporates many
+ *              ideas from the "Version 1.1" distributed previously by
+ *              him over the UNIX network Usenet.
+ *              I also thank Chaim Benedelac (National Semiconductor),
+ *              David Ditzel (SUN), Earl Killian and John Mashey (MIPS),
+ *              Alan Smith and Rafael Saavedra-Barrera (UC at Berkeley)
+ *              for their help with comments on earlier versions of the
+ *              benchmark.
+ *
+ *  Changes:    In the initialization part, this version follows mostly
+ *              Rick Richardson's version distributed via Usenet, not the
+ *              version distributed earlier via floppy disk by Reinhold Weicker.
+ *              As a concession to older compilers, names have been made
+ *              unique within the first 8 characters.
+ *              Inside the measurement loop, this version follows the
+ *              version previously distributed by Reinhold Weicker.
+ *
+ *              At several places in the benchmark, code has been added,
+ *              but within the measurement loop only in branches that 
+ *              are not executed. The intention is that optimizing compilers
+ *              should be prevented from moving code out of the measurement
+ *              loop, or from removing code altogether. Since the statements
+ *              that are executed within the measurement loop have NOT been
+ *              changed, the numbers defining the "Dhrystone distribution"
+ *              (distribution of statements, operand types and locality)
+ *              still hold. Except for sophisticated optimizing compilers,
+ *              execution times for this version should be the same as
+ *              for previous versions.
+ *              
+ *              Since it has proven difficult to subtract the time for the
+ *              measurement loop overhead in a correct way, the loop check
+ *              has been made a part of the benchmark. This does have
+ *              an impact - though a very minor one - on the distribution
+ *              statistics which have been updated for this version.
+ *
+ *              All changes within the measurement loop are described
+ *              and discussed in the companion paper "Rationale for
+ *              Dhrystone version 2".
+ *
+ *              Because of the self-imposed limitation that the order and
+ *              distribution of the executed statements should not be
+ *              changed, there are still cases where optimizing compilers
+ *              may not generate code for some statements. To a certain
+ *              degree, this is unavoidable for small synthetic benchmarks.
+ *              Users of the benchmark are advised to check code listings
+ *              whether code is generated for all statements of Dhrystone.
+ *
+ *              Version 2.1 is identical to version 2.0 distributed via
+ *              the UNIX network Usenet in March 1988 except that it corrects
+ *              some minor deficiencies that were found by users of version 2.0.
+ *              The only change within the measurement loop is that a
+ *              non-executed "else" part was added to the "if" statement in
+ *              Func_3, and a non-executed "else" part removed from Proc_3.
+ *
+ ***************************************************************************
+ *
+ * Defines:     The following "Defines" are possible:
+ *              -DREG=register          (default: Not defined)
+ *                      As an approximation to what an average C programmer
+ *                      might do, the "register" storage class is applied
+ *                      (if enabled by -DREG=register)
+ *                      - for local variables, if they are used (dynamically)
+ *                        five or more times
+ *                      - for parameters if they are used (dynamically)
+ *                        six or more times
+ *                      Note that an optimal "register" strategy is
+ *                      compiler-dependent, and that "register" declarations
+ *                      do not necessarily lead to faster execution.
+ *              -DNOSTRUCTASSIGN        (default: Not defined)
+ *                      Define if the C compiler does not support
+ *                      assignment of structures.
+ *              -DNOENUMS               (default: Not defined)
+ *                      Define if the C compiler does not support
+ *                      enumeration types.
+ *              -DTIMES                 (default)
+ *              -DTIME
+ *                      The "times" function of UNIX (returning process times)
+ *                      or the "time" function (returning wallclock time)
+ *                      is used for measurement. 
+ *                      For single user machines, "time ()" is adequate. For
+ *                      multi-user machines where you cannot get single-user
+ *                      access, use the "times ()" function. If you have
+ *                      neither, use a stopwatch in the dead of night.
+ *                      "printf"s are provided marking the points "Start Timer"
+ *                      and "Stop Timer". DO NOT use the UNIX "time(1)"
+ *                      command, as this will measure the total time to
+ *                      run this program, which will (erroneously) include
+ *                      the time to allocate storage (malloc) and to perform
+ *                      the initialization.
+ *              -DHZ=nnn
+ *                      In Berkeley UNIX, the function "times" returns process
+ *                      time in 1/HZ seconds, with HZ = 60 for most systems.
+ *                      CHECK YOUR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU JUST APPLY
+ *                      A VALUE.

+ *  Compilation model and measurement (IMPORTANT):
+ *
+ *  This C version of Dhrystone consists of three files:
+ *  - dhry.h (this file, containing global definitions and comments)
+ *  - dhry_1.c (containing the code corresponding to Ada package Pack_1)
+ *  - dhry_2.c (containing the code corresponding to Ada package Pack_2)
+ *
+ *  The following "ground rules" apply for measurements:
+ *  - Separate compilation
+ *  - No procedure merging
+ *  - Otherwise, compiler optimizations are allowed but should be indicated
+ *  - Default results are those without register declarations
+ *  See the companion paper "Rationale for Dhrystone Version 2" for a more
+ *  detailed discussion of these ground rules.
+ *
+ *  For 16-Bit processors (e.g. 80186, 80286), times for all compilation
+ *  models ("small", "medium", "large" etc.) should be given if possible,
+ *  together with a definition of these models for the compiler system used.
+ *

+ *
+ *  Dhrystone (C version) statistics:
+ *
+ *  [Comment from the first distribution, updated for version 2.
+ *   Note that because of language differences, the numbers are slightly
+ *   different from the Ada version.]
+ *
+ *  The following program contains statements of a high level programming
+ *  language (here: C) in a distribution considered representative:           
+ *
+ *    assignments                  52 (51.0 %)
+ *    control statements           33 (32.4 %)
+ *    procedure, function calls    17 (16.7 %)
+ *
+ *  103 statements are dynamically executed. The program is balanced with
+ *  respect to the three aspects:                                             
+ *
+ *    - statement type
+ *    - operand type
+ *    - operand locality
+ *         operand global, local, parameter, or constant.                     
+ *
+ *  The combination of these three aspects is balanced only approximately.
